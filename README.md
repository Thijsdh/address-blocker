    Address Blocker
</h1>

Address Blocker is a browser extension that can be used to block your personal details in your browser.
This can be useful to hide your address, phone number or any other personal details you want to hide during livestreams, meetings or other screen sharing events.
You can configure your own list of blocked terms in the extensions settings.

The blocker can easily be enabled and disabled by pressing the toggle button in the popup menu, which can also be used to configure your own filter list.
When the extension detects a text element containing any of these terms, it will replace the corresponding text with \*\*'s.

**Warning:
This extension is still in an early development stage.
While the extension managed to hide all terms during development successfully, it may still be possible for the extension to fail to detect your blocked terms in some cases.
Please use this extension with caution.**
